<section class="about">
<div class="inner">
  <p>Before design, there were many smaller passions, various ‘loves’ that I had envisioned myself seriously pursuing: math, poetry, nature, drawing, music. When I had grasped fully the gravity of what I wanted to do, I realized I had always picked apart those passions – I was enthused by their functionings, solaced by their forms; I was always a designer.</p>
  <p>Everything stayed as small passions that still find themselves intertwined in my work as a designer. Music, most notably, has always been – and will always remain – a love of my life. Music continues to be my muse, the catalyst of my findings, a wonderful inner voice which has influenced my design work to go further, moving from my timid beginnings to courageous resolutions in an endless crescendo.</p>
  <p>This book is an ode to my passions. Every influence can be seen in my academic work. Everything I’ve ever loved has always been a part of the grand design.</p>
